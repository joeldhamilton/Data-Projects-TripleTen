# Introduction: Churn Prediction for Interconnect

## Project Overview
Interconnect, a prominent telecom operator, is facing a critical business challenge: customer churn. In today's competitive telecommunications market, retaining existing customers is as crucial as acquiring new ones. To address this, Interconnect has initiated a data-driven project to forecast customer churn, aiming to proactively retain at-risk customers through targeted promotional offers and specialized plan options.

## Business Context
Interconnect provides a range of services including:
1. Landline communication
2. Internet services (DSL and fiber optic)
3. Additional services such as internet security, technical support, online backup, and streaming services

Customers can opt for monthly payments or commit to 1- or 2-year contracts, with various payment methods available. This diverse service offering and flexible contract structure add complexity to understanding and predicting customer behavior.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:
1. Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict customer churn
2. Identify key factors influencing customer decisions to leave
3. Provide actionable insights to the marketing team for targeted retention strategies

## Data Assets
We have access to a rich dataset comprising customer information from multiple sources:
- Contract information
- Personal data
- Internet service details
- Telephone service usage

This comprehensive dataset, valid as of February 1, 2020, provides a solid foundation for our analysis and model development.

## Success Criteria
The project's success will be primarily measured by the model's AUC-ROC score, with the following benchmarks:
- Minimum acceptable: AUC-ROC ≥ 0.75
- Target: AUC-ROC ≥ 0.85
- Exceptional: AUC-ROC ≥ 0.88

Additionally, we will consider the model's accuracy as a secondary metric to ensure balanced performance.

## Project Impact
By successfully predicting customer churn, Interconnect can:
1. Implement proactive retention strategies
2. Optimize resource allocation for customer retention efforts
3. Improve overall customer satisfaction and loyalty
4. Potentially increase revenue and market share in a competitive industry

This project represents a critical step in Interconnect's data-driven decision-making process, aligning technological capabilities with strategic business objectives.

# Overall Conclusion: Churn Prediction Project for Interconnect

This project aimed to develop a predictive model for customer churn at Interconnect, a telecom operator. Through comprehensive data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, we've created a robust model that can effectively identify customers at risk of churning. Here are the key findings and insights from our work:

## Data Insights
1. The dataset comprised 7,032 customer records with an overall churn rate of 26.58%.
2. Key customer attributes included contract details, personal information, internet and phone services, and payment methods.

## Feature Engineering and Selection
1. We engineered new features such as 'tenure_months', 'charge_per_month', and 'total_services'.
2. After correlation analysis and feature selection, we identified 12 key features most predictive of churn.

## Model Development
1. Our final model, an optimized XGBoost classifier, achieved impressive performance:
   - AUC-ROC: 0.9233
   - Accuracy: 0.8571
2. This represents an 84.66% performance lift over a baseline dummy classifier.

## Key Predictors of Churn
1. Financial Factors:
   - 'totalcharges', 'charge_per_month', and 'monthlycharges' were the top three predictors.
2. Service-Related Factors:
   - 'total_services' and 'internetservice_Fiber optic' also showed significant importance.
3. Contract Type:
   - Two-year contracts appeared more influential in reducing churn than one-year contracts.
4. Payment Method:
   - Electronic check payments were associated with higher churn risk.

## Actionable Insights
1. Pricing Strategy: Review and optimize pricing structures, as financial factors are the strongest predictors of churn.
2. Service Bundles: Encourage customers to adopt more services, potentially through attractive bundled offerings.
3. Contract Length: Promote longer-term contracts, which are associated with lower churn risk.
4. Fiber Optic Service: Investigate the relationship between fiber optic internet and churn. Consider enhancing this service or its perceived value.
5. Payment Methods: Analyze why customers using electronic checks for payment might be at higher risk of churning. Develop targeted retention strategies for this group.

## Next Steps
1. Model Deployment: Integrate the churn prediction model into Interconnect's customer management systems.
2. Continuous Monitoring: Regularly update and retrain the model to ensure ongoing accuracy.
3. A/B Testing: Implement and test retention strategies based on the model's insights.
4. Customer Feedback: Gather qualitative data from customers to complement the quantitative insights from the model.

By leveraging these insights and implementing data-driven strategies, Interconnect can work towards reducing customer churn, improving customer satisfaction, and ultimately enhancing its competitive position in the telecom market.
