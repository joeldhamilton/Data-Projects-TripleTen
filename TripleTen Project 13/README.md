# Introduction - Sweet Lift Taxi Order Prediction

**Introduction**

Sweet Lift Taxi company is looking to optimize their operations by predicting taxi order demand at airports during peak hours. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can forecast the number of taxi orders for the next hour based on historical data.

**Project Objectives:**
1. Analyze historical taxi order data from airports.
2. Develop a predictive model to forecast hourly taxi order demand.
3. Achieve an RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 48 or less on the test set.

**Key Steps:**
1. Data Preparation: Download and resample the provided dataset by one hour.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze patterns and trends in the taxi order data.
3. Model Development: Train various models with different hyperparameters.
4. Model Evaluation: Test the models using a 10% holdout set and compare their performance.
5. Conclusion and Recommendations: Summarize findings and suggest the best model for implementation.

## Sweet Lift Taxi Order Prediction Project Conclusion

**Project Overview**
The Sweet Lift Taxi company aimed to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour at airports to optimize driver allocation during peak hours. The goal was to develop a model with an RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 48 or less on the test set.

**Key Findings**
1. Data Analysis:
   - Clear daily and weekly seasonality patterns in taxi order volume
   - Right-skewed distribution of hourly orders with a mean of 84 orders/hour
   - Distinct patterns in order volume throughout the day and week

2. Model Performance:
   - Random Forest: RMSE of 42.80 (Best performing)
   - XGBoost: RMSE of 44.65
   - Linear Regression: RMSE of 45.03
   - SARIMA: RMSE of 47.68


3. Feature Importance:
   - Lag features were among the most important predictors
   - Hour of the day and day of the week also played significant roles

4. Model Evaluation:
   - RMSE: 43.31 (meeting the project goal of < 48)
   - MAE: 32.22
   - R-squared: 0.4671

**Conclusions**
1. The Random Forest model successfully met the project requirement with an RMSE of 43.31, outperforming other models.
2. Ensemble methods, particularly those capturing non-linear relationships and feature interactions, proved most effective for this task.
3. Time series components are crucial in predicting taxi orders, as evidenced by the strong performance of the SARIMA model.
4. The model's performance varies by hour, suggesting room for potential improvements in handling time-based patterns.

**Recommendations**
1. Implement the Random Forest model for predicting hourly taxi orders.
2. Consider developing separate models for different times of day to improve overall performance.
3. Continuously monitor and retrain the model to adapt to changing patterns in taxi order demand.
4. Explore combining ensemble methods with advanced time series techniques for potential future improvements.
5. Investigate additional external factors (e.g., weather, events) that might influence taxi order demand for future model iterations.

By implementing these recommendations, Sweet Lift Taxi can optimize its driver allocation during peak hours, improving service efficiency and customer satisfaction.
