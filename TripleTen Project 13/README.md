#### TripleTen Project 13 - Time Series Forecasting for Taxi Order Prediction
- Sweet Lift Taxi, a company operating at airports, needed to predict hourly taxi order volumes to optimize driver allocation during peak hours. The project aimed to develop a machine learning model to forecast taxi orders for the next hour using historical data.
- Developed a high-performing Random Forest model that surpassed the project's target RMSE of 48, achieving an RMSE of 42.80 on the test set. This was accomplished by implementing and comparing multiple time series forecasting models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SARIMA, while leveraging feature engineering techniques such as lag features and time-based attributes.
- Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis that revealed crucial patterns in taxi order demand, resulting in effective feature engineering and model selection. This was achieved by analyzing hourly, daily, and weekly seasonality patterns, performing time series decomposition, and examining autocorrelation structures to inform the modeling approach.
