#### TripleTen Project 14 - Automated Sentiment Analysis System for Movie Review Classification | July 2024
- The Film Junky Union, an emerging community for classic movie enthusiasts, required an automated system to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The project aimed to develop a machine learning model to accurately detect sentiment in user-submitted reviews.
- Developed a high-performing sentiment analysis model that exceeded the project's target F1 score of 0.85, achieving an F1 score of 0.88 on the test set. This was accomplished by implementing and comparing multiple text classification models, including TF-IDF vectorization with Logistic Regression, LightGBM, and BERT embeddings.
- Optimized model selection and feature engineering processes, resulting in a computationally efficient solution that outperformed more complex models. This was achieved by conducting thorough exploratory data analysis, implementing various text preprocessing techniques, and performing comparative analysis of model performance across different architectures.
