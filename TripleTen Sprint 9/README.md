#### TripleTen Project 9 - Data-Driven Oil Well Location Optimization
- OilyGiant, a mining company, needed to determine the best location for a new oil well to maximize profits. The project aimed to analyze oil well data from three regions, build predictive models, and recommend the optimal region for development based on profitability and risk assessment.
- Developed a high-performing linear regression model for Region 1 that achieved an RMSE of 0.89, significantly outperforming models for other regions. This was accomplished by implementing and comparing linear regression models across three regions, utilizing feature engineering and careful data preprocessing techniques.
- Conducted comprehensive risk analysis using bootstrapping techniques, resulting in the identification of Region 1 as the optimal development location with an expected profit of $4.39 million and only 1.7% risk of loss. This was achieved by performing 1000 bootstrap iterations to estimate profit distributions, calculating confidence intervals, and assessing risk levels for each region.
