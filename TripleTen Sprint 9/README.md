# Introduction

As a data scientist at OilyGiant mining company, I have been tasked with finding the optimal location to develop a new oil well that will maximize profits for the company. To do this, I will analyze oil well data from three different regions, build a linear regression model to predict the volume of reserves in new wells, and use the model to estimate the potential profits and risks for each region. 

The project will involve several key steps:
1. Collecting and preparing oil well data for each region, including oil quality and volume of reserves
2. Building and evaluating a linear regression model for each region using a train/test split 
3. Calculating the minimum volume of reserves needed for a profitable new well
4. Selecting the best oil wells in each region based on the model's predictions
5. Estimating the total profit for the top well sites in each region
6. Assessing the potential profit and loss risks for each region using the bootstrapping statistical technique
7. Recommending the optimal region for development based on which one offers the highest estimated profit with a risk of loss below 2.5%

By carefully analyzing the data, building predictive models, and weighing potential risks and rewards, this project aims to provide a data-driven recommendation for where OilyGiant can develop a new oil well to maximize returns on its investment. The datasets, code, and detailed findings from each stage of the analysis are presented in the following sections.

# Conlcusion

Based on the comprehensive analysis conducted throughout this project, we can draw the following conclusions:

1. Model Performance: Among the three regions analyzed, Region 1 demonstrated the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy, with the lowest RMSE of 0.89. This suggests that our linear regression model is most reliable for predicting oil reserves in Region 1.

2. Profit Potential: Initially, when considering average reserves, none of the regions appeared profitable. However, by using our predictive model to select the most promising wells, all three regions showed potential for profit.

3. Risk and Profit Analysis: After applying bootstrapping techniques to assess risk:

   - Region 1 emerged as the most promising, with an average profit of $4,387,154.86 and the lowest risk of loss at 1.70%.
   - Region 0 showed higher potential profits but also higher risk, with a 6.5% chance of loss.
   - Region 2 had the highest risk at 8.1%, despite showing potential for high profits.

4. Final Recommendation: Based on the project's risk tolerance threshold of 2.5%, Region 1 is the only area that meets this criterion. It offers the best balance of profit potential and risk mitigation.

In conclusion, we recommend that OilyGiant focus its oil well development efforts on Region 1. This strategy is expected to yield an average profit of over $4.3 million while maintaining a low 1.70% risk of loss. This approach aligns with the company's risk tolerance and offers the most prudent investment opportunity among the three regions analyzed.

It's important to note that while Regions 0 and 2 show potential for higher profits, their risk levels exceed the company's acceptable threshold. However, these regions could be considered for future exploration or development if the company's risk tolerance changes or if additional risk mitigation strategies can be implemented.

Moving forward, OilyGiant should:
1. Prioritize development in Region 1
2. Continue refining the predictive model, especially for Region 1
3. Consider further geological studies in Regions 0 and 2 to potentially reduce risk in these areas for future development

This data-driven approach should position OilyGiant to maximize its return on investment while managing risk appropriately in its oil well development strategy.
